::To create ansible master node at virtual box and ec2 instance as target node:

1> create ec2 instance with key-value pair

2> open the Linux separate terminal  other than ansible master node to configure the ssh connection

3> First change the permission of privatekey.pem file
	chmod 400 privatekey.pem

4> Run the command to connect to your EC2 instance
	ssh -i /path-to-the-private-key/privatekey.pem ubuntu@public-ip
	ssh -i ~/Downloads/privatekey.pem ubuntu@public-ip

5> Setup for ansible (passwordless authentication) 
  
 a> Generate public key first on master node. This will generate the public  key in "~/.ssh" location as id_rsa.pub
     ssh-keygen -t rsa

  
 b> on master node copy the public  key to your target ec2 instance 
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@public-ip

				OR 

  If option b doesn't works  out  then we can copy te content of id_rsa.pub key and paste it at the target location.
        1> ssh ubuntu@public-ip
	2> vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  >> paste the public key content 


6> Now run some adhoc command on master node
	ansible -i inventory_name hosts_name_OR_all -m modulename "command you want to push"
	ansible -i inventory.ini webservers -m shell " touch ~/myfile.txt "

7> Ansible playbook syntax
	ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini webservers playbook_name.yaml
